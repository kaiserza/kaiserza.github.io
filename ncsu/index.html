			<p><em>The Dr. Pawel Norway Dream Machine</em> is a hybrid transmedia performance-exhibition. The project explores the work of the fictional Dr. Pawel Norway, a visionary (if misguided) doctor from mid-19th century London, and attempts to recreate his experiments utilizing modern technologies, specifically those of the quantified self. The piece has been exhibited and performed in two different iterations, first at the Calit2 Theater at UC-San Diego (Nov. 2016), and then at Icebox Projects, Philadelphia (Sept/Oct, 2017).

			<h2>Our Program / The Quantified Professoriate (2016-present)

			<p><em>Our Program</em> began as a video piece and an object, which seeks to question the metrification of academia. It has extended into a series of interventions which are forthcoming through <em>Art Journal</em> (in print and online) in Spring/Summer 2018. </p>

			<p>The proposal I am submitting for the NCSU Visualizing Digital Scholarship in Libraries and Learning Spaces Creative Residency Program is related very closely to this project, and I see the proposed project as an important evolution/extension of it.</p>

		<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/179276376">Our Program</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/zacharykaiser">Zachary Kaiser</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

			<p><em>Our Program</em> is a speculation on the neoliberal future-present of higher education. The scenario the film presents is one in which faculty members at colleges and universities are consistently and perpetually evaluated in real time through sophisticated metrics that track every aspect of their activities. The evaluative metrics are displayed, for all to see, on small &ldquo;tickers&rdquo; that sit outside each faculty member&rsquo;s office. These metrics are, exclusively, how performance is judged, and this emphasis on the quantifiability of all aspects of everyday life points towards a larger trend in society as a whole: under the influence of companies that lead us to believe the data they gather about us is somehow objective or &ldquo;real,&rdquo; we understand ourselves to be nothing but data. Our collective subjectivity is one of computability. Not unlike the way in which the sharing of our FitBit data has become not only normative, but in some cases, institutionally incentivized or even mandated, the implementation of systems to quantify all aspects of faculty activity will become compulsory, and, believing themselves to be nothing but data, anyway, faculty&mdash;and society&mdash;will agree. This film presents the intellectual and cultural sensibility that emerges from this devastating concession.

			<p><em>Plateaus</em> is an artistic intervention that seeks to raise awareness of the geological-scale impact of digital technologies and the social, political, and environmental impact of mining these minerals for electronics, and, in doing so, help us come to grips with our relationship to media and the ways in which we experience it: media not as an immaterial phenomenon but as a geological phenomenon, as something composed of minerals harvested from the earth. By examining and representing the role of media consumption in the geological history and future of the earth, the project calls into question the ideologies driving the design and production of what have become our most treasured companions: our mobile devices.
