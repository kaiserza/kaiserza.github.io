				<p class="meow">Over the course of the 2019 spring semester, the seniors in the Capstone Course of the <a href="http://xa.cal.msu.edu">Experience Architecture program at Michigan State University</a> spent time thinking about how they wanted to intentionally approach their careers as User Experience professionals. Amidst the many discussions that took place in class, an urgency about the politics and ethics of UX emerged that seemed to necessitate giving the students an opportunity to think through some of these issues together, both verbally and in writing. We decided to offer the students the opportunity to author short opinion pieces about anything related to the various intersections of technology and society in which they were interested. The "Class Compendium," entitled "Power/Peril: On Technolgy and Society" is the result.
